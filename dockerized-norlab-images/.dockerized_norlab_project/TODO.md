# TODO

- [ ] validate that `dockerized-norlab-images/.dockerized_norlab_project/dn_container_env_variable` is not used somewhere 
- [ ] validate that `dockerized-norlab-images/.dockerized_norlab_project` dir can be deleted safely from the `dockerized-norlab` repository.
- [ ] delete `dockerized-norlab-images/.dockerized_norlab_project` and content

# Note
Dir `dockerized-norlab-images/.dockerized_norlab_project/dn_container_env_variable` was probably automaticaly generated accidentaly as there is another one at `dockerized-norlab-tools/dn_container_env_variable`
